# Naive Bayes

- Na誰ve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
- It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
- Some popular examples of Na誰ve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.
- There are 3 types of Na誰ve Bayes algorithm. The 3 types are listed below that have been used herein:-

## *Gaussian Naive Bayes* : 
The Gaussian model assumes that features follow a normal distribution. This means if predictors take continuous values instead of discrete, then the model assumes that these values are sampled from the Gaussian distribution.
## *Multinomial Naive Bayes* : 
The Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes classifier is used when the data is multinomial distributed. It is primarily used for document classification problems, it means a particular document belongs to which category such as Sports, Politics, education, etc.
The classifier uses the frequency of words for the predictors.
## *Bernoulli* :
The Bernoulli classifier works similar to the Multinomial classifier, but the predictor variables are the independent Booleans variables. Such as if a particular word is present or not in a document. This model is also famous for document classification tasks.

# KNN

K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.

Here, I used KNN to predict the chances of survivval of passangers on the titanic ship wreck based on numerous other variables.
